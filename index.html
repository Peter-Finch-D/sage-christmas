    <h1>MERRY CHRISTMAS, SAGE!!!</h1>
    <h1>Here is a little website dedicated to revisiting our memories!</h1>
    <h1>Most of them are from this year :) but they are in chronological order. We begin with...</h1>

            <p>Our trip to New Hampshire in 2023! Can you tell from Ty's face he is in excruciating pain from the cyst on his leg?</p>

            <p>And this is when we went and played paint ball, in this picture it's my leg / butt that's in excruciating pain because you SHOT ME WHEN I WAS ON YOUR TEAM</p.>

            <p>Our wonderful trip to San Diego Zoo! Do you remember how we were fighting in the car about the different methods to raise kids? Seems so silly now. This was the best zoo visit ever.</p>

            <img src="imgs/IMG_3255.jpeg" alt="Image 3">
            <p>Can you guess where this is? Yes, Sage. MISSOULA! Floating on the river with you and meeting that random guy in the kayak with the girls on the tube was probably the most relaxed I'd ever been. And then the restaurant we went to after? Finn, I think? One of the best meals of my life!</p>

            <p>RAWR XD. Hope we never get that close to Grizzly bears ever again! But I'm so glad you came with me to Glacier. The most beautiful view in the whole park was staring into your eyes :)</p>

            <img src="imgs/IMG_3415.jpeg" alt="Image 3">
            <p>Lake McDonald was slightly less exciting than the bears, but I think that's a good thing. I put this one in here as a reminder that we need to go back together to do Kayaking on the lake.</p>

            <img src="imgs/IMG_3447.jpeg" alt="Image 3">
            <p>As overpriced as Margaritaville was, we look SO CUTE in this photo. I wish my little balloon hat could have stayed inflated forever so I could keep it as a memory like the birthday hats from Queen Charlotte</p>

            <img src="imgs/IMG_3508.jpeg" alt="Image 3">
            <p>We got cool pictures with Beetlejuice before the new movie came out and he was cool again! My favorite part of this show was when the performers said it was that kid from Tennessee, Sawyer, who was throwing cigarrettes at them and drinking beer in the crowd.</p>

            <p>This place was so scary! But I had the best time this Halloween going to Haunted Houses with you :)</p>

            <p>Last, but certainly not least, us all dressed up at the holiday ball! This was such a fun night, I appreciate you so much because you're so good at making me come out of my shell.</p>
